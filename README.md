# Monte-Carlo-Win_Totals_Sim  
This github repo is intended for anyone interested in simulating win-loss regular season records of the 30 NBA teams.
As of now, all 30 teams are equally likely to win each game. Future pull requests to make every team have their own probability of winning each game played would be great.
